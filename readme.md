# Cavtools Enlistments

## Setup

Update local /etc/hosts to include

```
127.0.0.1 local.7cav.us
```

Ensure you have a version of Xenforo 2 downloaded, then place the contents of `/upload` inside the base directory of this repo.

For example, the `src` directory in the Xenforo installation should match up with the one included here already.
